##Convolutional Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST Image Reconstruction and Clothing Classification


Initially, I designed a convolutional autoencoder to recreate the clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Subsequently, I selected the best parameters within the tested range. Finally, utilizing the encoder weights of the pre-trained autoencoder, I developed a clothing classifier network with 10 possible labels. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 92%, and additionally, a confusion matrix was plotted.
